This repository contains coursework from my final year module "Modern Computational Techniques".

Assignment 1 involves studying the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation using Fortran/Lapack.

Assignment 2 includes Fourier transforms, Neural networks, Monte Carlo Methods and Parallel programming.

  Part 1: Training a neural network with the Metropolis algorithm to reproduce an XOR gate.
  
  Part 2: Takes a sample of data length 2^n for integer n and calculates the Fourier transform, implementing paralellisation using OpenMP.
